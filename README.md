# Cocktail Frontend
Cocktail Frontend connects to the Cocktail API (www.thecocktaildb.com/api/) and allows users to search for cocktails either by name or by retrieving a random cocktail. It was developed to meet the requirements of MSA Phase 2 Frontend.

Below is an example demonstrating the search functionality
